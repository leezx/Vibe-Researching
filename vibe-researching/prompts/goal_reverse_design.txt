My delivery target is: {VENUE}

Constraints:
- Data: {DATA_TYPES}
- No new wet lab experiments
- Timeline: {TIMELINE}
- Output: {PAPER_TYPE} (e.g., workshop tiny paper / full paper)

Reverse-design:
1) What story skeleton does this venue expect?
2) Minimum complete figure set (must-have) vs optional (nice-to-have).
3) Reviewer risk register: top likely critiques + minimal defenses.
4) Explicit scope boundaries: what we will NOT do.
