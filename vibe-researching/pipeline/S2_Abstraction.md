# S2 — Vibe → Explicit Abstraction
Goal: translate vague intuition into a concrete scientific gap or missing assumption with a minimal evidence path.

## Outputs
- a one-sentence missing abstraction
- the implicit assumption in mainstream methods that causes the gap
- a minimal, public-data evidence plan

## GPT usage
- allowed: abstraction, constraint surfacing, counterexamples
- forbidden: architecture-first solutioning before the gap is crisp

## Exit criteria
- you can state the gap without metaphor
- you can list at least 2 predictions that follow
- you can name the minimal evidence objects required
