# S3 — Goal-Conditioned Research Design
Goal: fix a submission target and design the smallest complete story that will be accepted there.

## Outputs
- venue-aligned story skeleton
- figure plan (minimum complete set)
- analysis plan (must-have vs nice-to-have)
- explicit scope boundaries

## GPT usage
- reverse-design from venue criteria
- simulate reviewer questions specific to the venue
- enforce scope control

## Exit criteria
- you can defend why each figure must exist
- you can explain what you are NOT doing (and why)
