# S4 — Paper Assembly Line (Figure-driven execution)
Goal: execute analysis and writing as an evidence production line.

## Canonical order
1) figure question
2) analysis code
3) visualization
4) interpretation (claim bounded to evidence)
5) methods (reproducible)
6) discussion (implications + limitations)
7) abstract + title

## Mandatory loops
- Reality Check: if results do not support the claim, change analysis or question, not rhetoric.
- Hostile Reviewer: repeatedly test for ambiguity and missing controls.

## Exit criteria
- every claim points to a figure/table
- every figure answers a defined question
- the paper survives a hostile reviewer pass without major holes
