# S1 — Top-tier Signal Accumulation
Goal: learn what kinds of abstractions and evidence patterns trigger acceptance in top venues.

## Methods
- maintain a curated reading list of top-tier papers
- analyze author intent: what gap was real at the time?
- map each paper to: claim size, evidence objects, failure boundaries

## GPT usage
Use GPT to:
- infer implicit reviewer standards
- reverse-engineer paper structure
- identify the “missing abstraction” each paper introduced

## Exit criteria
- you can predict reviewer expectations for your target venue
- you can explain why a paper is top-tier beyond “it’s novel”
