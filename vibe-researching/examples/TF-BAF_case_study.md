# Example Case Study: TF–BAF Coupling (placeholder)

This file is a template for documenting a full end-to-end run of the pipeline on a concrete project.

## S0 — Embodiment
- Domain: chromatin remodeling (BAF/SWI-SNF), TF binding, cancer epigenetics
- Immersion artifacts: key papers, talks, datasets, confusion list

## S1 — Signal
- Top-tier triggers: interface-specific execution layers; structural biology cues; mechanistic-to-computational bridge

## S2 — Abstraction
- Missing abstraction: TF programs require context-specific chromatin execution machinery (TF–BAF coupling)
- Why mainstream generative models miss it: chromatin is absorbed as a homogeneous latent factor

## S3 — Goal-conditioned design
- Venue target: {WORKSHOP/JOURNAL}
- Minimum figure set: {FIGURE PLAN}

## S4 — Execution
- Figure-by-figure: analysis → code → plots → interpretation → methods

## Loops
- Iterative deepening: reproduction tests for every key claim
- Iterative rewriting: hostile reviewer passes + expert feedback integration
